### üë§ Identity: OpenID Connect & OAuth 2 Models Collection

Your Go-To Collection for OpenID Connect & OAuth 2 Models in ASP.NET Core. It's not just a collection of helper models, it's your secret weapon for simplifying the complex world of authentication and authorization.

The `Identity` collection has been painstakingly curated to provide developers with the most useful and relevant models for implementing OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 protocols. Each model has been designed with flexibility and ease-of-use in mind, allowing you to focus on crafting secure, robust, and user-friendly authentication and authorization systems.

The power of `Identity` comes from its versatility. Whether you're building an enterprise-level application with intricate security requirements, or a small personal project, `Identity` can adapt to your needs.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security: Advanced ASP.NET Core Security Extensions

An innovative extension to the native ASP.NET Core Security, engineered to bring advanced, robust features to better secure your applications.

In the digital era, the safety of your applications is not just a best practice, it's a crucial necessity. With the rise of cyber threats and data breaches, it's imperative to have a security solution that's not just strong, but also adaptable and forward-thinking.

`Security` is a powerful library that enriches the native ASP.NET Core Security with additional capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and proactive security solution for your applications. Our mission is to provide a sturdy security foundation, ensuring your applications stand resilient against evolving threats.
